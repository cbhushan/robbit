<p>Robbit is a open-source software which provide 3D simulation environment for multiple robot system.  Robbit has been developed thinking in researchers, students, roboticists and hobbyists who want to design, test and simulate mobile robots and research topics like autonomous navigation techniques, obstacle avoidance, artificial intelligence etc. </p>

<p>At the moment, Robbit supports modules for mobile robots only. However, in the future the scope should expand and, of course, contributions are most welcome. </p>

<p>Well, it so happens that one of us was highly impressed by the <a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">Lord of the Rings</a> series especially by resilience of some good-natured hairy-footed creatures called <a href="http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Hobbits">hobbits</a>. And voila! Robbit it was. Robots that Hobbles. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Abstract: An open source software, named ROBBIT, aimed at the simulation of multiple mobile robots has been developed at the Universita degli Studi di Cassino, Italy together with students coming from the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India. The main project's objective was to develop a software platform with educational purposes in robotics, computer sciences, non-linear control, behavioral and cognitive sciences. Several potential applications have been identified in order to use this software as a teaching tool for graduate, master thesis and PhD students. ROBBIT is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). </p>

<p>The simulator can take the pre-saved datafile (ASCII format) to implement offline simulation as well as the code itself to implement online simulation. For both the offline and online situations, simulator provide following features :</p>

<ul>
<li>Panaromic view through mouse control</li>
<li>Pan in 3D</li>
<li>Instantaneous snapshot</li>
<li>Play/Pause</li>
<li>Animation speed control</li>
<li>Lighting Control</li>
<li>Zoom In/Out</li>
<li>On board view</li>
<li>Placing obstacle (by reading from ASCII file)</li>
<li>Motion trails</li>
<li>Numbering Robots</li>
<li>Collision detection (through colour changes)</li>
<li>Arena resizing</li>
<li>Auto-rotating view</li>
<li>Time-slider when reading from log files</li>
</ul>
