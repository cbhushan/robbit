{"name":"Robbit","tagline":"3D simulator for multiple robot system","body":"# What is Robbit ?\r\nRobbit is a open-source software which provide 3D simulation environment for multiple robot system.  Robbit has been developed thinking in researchers, students, roboticists and hobbyists who want to design, test and simulate mobile robots and research topics like autonomous navigation techniques, obstacle avoidance, artificial intelligence etc. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, Robbit supports modules for mobile robots only. However, in the future the scope should expand and, of course, contributions are most welcome. \r\n\r\n\r\n## The Name\r\nWell, it so happens that one of us was highly impressed by the [Lord of the Rings](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings) series especially by resilience of some good-natured hairy-footed creatures called [hobbits](http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Hobbits). And voila! Robbit it was. Robots that Hobbles. \r\n\r\n## Conference Paper\r\nRobbit was featured in [MATHMOD 2009](http://www.mathmod.at/index.php?id=87) - 6th Vienna International Conference on Mathematical Modelling - took place February 11 - 13, 2009.

The main project's objective was to develop a software platform with educational purposes in robotics, computer sciences, non-linear control, behavioral and cognitive sciences. Several potential applications have been identified in order to use this software as a teaching tool for graduate, master thesis and PhD students. ROBBIT is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). \r\n\r\n# Features\r\nThe simulator can take the pre-saved datafile (ASCII format) to implement offline simulation as well as the code itself to implement online simulation. For both the offline and online situations, simulator provide following features :\r\n\r\n* Panaromic view through mouse control\r\n* Pan in 3D\r\n* Instantaneous snapshot\r\n* Play/Pause\r\n* Animation speed control\r\n* Lighting Control\r\n* Zoom In/Out\r\n* On board view\r\n* Placing obstacle (by reading from ASCII file)\r\n* Motion trails\r\n* Numbering Robots\r\n* Collision detection (through colour changes)\r\n* Arena resizing\r\n* Auto-rotating view\r\n* Time-slider when reading from log files\r\n\r\n## Supported Robots\r\n* Khepera II\r\n* Khepera III\r\n* Custom Robots\r\n\r\n## Documentation \r\nDetailed documentation is available here.
