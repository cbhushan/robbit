All the dependencies must be fulfilled prior to installation. see website [ http://webuser.unicas.it/robbit/ ] for all the dependencies.

Open Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Solution robbit.sln, which can be found in vc2005 directory.
Build the solution. robbit.exe will be created in the same directory.

For windows installation using VC2005, the external libraries used are present in the include/ folder. 
This includes FL headers and libraries (static), and LibPNG headers and libraries (static). 
OpenGL headers and DLLs need to installed separately. The installer for GLUT on win32 is given in the folder 
'glut-3.7.6-win32 installer/' folder.

Presently, the solution is built in release mode only. Feel free to experiment with the debug mode. (you will have to include the debug 
libraries like fltkd.lib & the like)
Please note that the solution is configured to use the library files with relative locations, hence I shall 
take relocating this (include/) folder as an offence :P.

In case you are planning to create your own vc2005 project (god forbid), do have a look at the original project 
settings. Full Optimization is recommended. You may also point the include directories to your own existing installation 
of FLTK and PNG libraries. Don't forget to add the following to the additional dependencies for your Linker: 
"opengl32.lib wsock32.lib comctl32.lib glaux.lib glu32.lib fltk.lib fltkgl.lib libpng.lib".

Cheers.
